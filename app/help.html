                    <p>To join a class, click on the ``Join Class'' button located below your list of classes, on the home page.</p>
                    <p>From here, you have the ability to search for a class, either by class code, class name, or lecturer name. Your lecturer should give information on what to search for to find their class.</p>
                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="studentjoiningaclass">Joining a Class</h5>
                    <p>To join a class, click on the ``Join Class'' button located below your list of classes, on the home page.</p>

                    <p>From here, you have the ability to search for a class, either by class code, class name, or lecturer name. Your lecturer should give information on what to search for to find their class.</p>

                    <p>After joining a class, it should now appear on your homepage, accessible by clicking on the logo at the top of the screen. From here, you can access the classes page.</p>

                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="studentleavingaclass">Leaving a Class</h5>
                    <p>To leave a class, all you have to do is click the ``Leave'' button located on the class page. After confirming this, you will be removed from the class.</p>

                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="studentaccessinglectures">Accessing Lectures</h5>
                    <p>From the home page, clicking on the desired class will bring you to the list of lectures for that class. If a lecture is greyed out rather than purple, this means that the class owner has not yet made the lecture visible.</p>
                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="studentaccessingquestions">Accessing Questions</h5>
                    <p>From the lecture page, clicking on the desired lecture will bring you to the list of lectures for that class (see button 1 in figure \ref{fig:studentlectures}). If the question is greyed out rather than purple ), this means that the class owner has not yet made the question visible. If the question isn't greyed out, simply press the ``Open'' button to access that question.</p>

                    <p>To update your questions to the latest data, press the ``question update'' button.</p>

                    <p>From the question page, there is also buttons at the top to access the previous/next visible question.</p>

                    <p>From the question page, you are able to answer questions with buttons shown below the text.</p>
                    <p>You are only allowed to submit one answer, so be careful with what you choose. Your lecturer is not able to identify who answered who, so answers are anonymous. You will receive a notification telling you if you were correct or otherwise.</p>

                    <p>To create a class, simply click the ``New Class'' button located at the bottom of the home page.</p>

                    <p>You'll be given a blank page that you will need to fill in.</p>

                    <p>Class code (required): the code of the class you are adding. If your class does not have a code, just make one up that you can give out to potential students.
                        <br> Class name (required): the name of the class you are giving.
                        <br> Class description (optional): A description of the class that will appear on searches/the student's homepage.</p>

                    <p>You also have two toggle switches. The first is ``accessible''. This option ``locks'' the classes' page to enrolled students, so they won't be able to see the lectures/questions within. The second is ``Joinable'', this is whether or not the class shows up on the search system.</p>

                    <p>You won't be able to add lectures until the class is created.</p>
                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="lecturereditingaclass">Editing a Class</h5>
                    <p>To edit a class, simply click on the ``Edit'' button on the right of the class information panel. You can also click the ``Edit Class'' button at the bottom of the class lecture list.</p>

                            <li>- Remove students from the class.</li>
                            <li>- Edit lectures, including a ``quick'' edit option for accessibility (whether or not students can open the lecture).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        There is also a toggle switch for accessibility: this option ``locks'' the lecture's page to enrolled students, so they won't be able to see the questions within.</p>

                    <p>You are required to save a lecture before adding questions to it.

                    <p>

                    <p>

                        From here, you'll see all the questions currently in the lecture (if there is any). To add a new question, simply click the ``Add More Questions'' button located at the bottom of the page.</p>
                    <p>

                        You will be provided with a blank question template to fill out.</p>
                    <p>
                        This template involves 3 sections.
                        <ul>
                            <li>- ``Question Text'' - The text you want the students to see when they click on the question.</li>

                            <li>- ``Buttons'' - This section lets you construct the buttons you want the students to see when they click on the question. This is completely flexible, and involves three sections.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>- - ``Button Text'' - The text displayed in the button.</li>
                                <il>- - ``Set as Answer'' - Whether or not this button is the correct answer.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a couple of restrictions to questions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Each button must have a text.</li>
                            <li>- There must be an answer.</ili </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have valid questions, simply click ``Save'' located at the bottom of the page and the questions will be saved.</p>
                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="lecturerviewingresponses">Viewing Responses</h5>
                    <p>To view the responses to a specific lecture or question, navigate to the lecture page in question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here, there is two ways to access the responses:
                        <br> Firstly, the ``responses'' button located at the top right of the page will take you to the first question response.
                        <br> Secondly, the ``responses'' button located at the right of each question will take you to the responses page for the specified question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here, if there is at least one response to a question, there will be a pie chart visible. If not, there will not be, but will appear when a response is taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the bottom of the page, the question you are currently on will be highlighted green. Clicking on a different question button will take you to the specified question's response page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The responses update in real time and do not require a refresh.</p>
                    <p>There is also an option to clear responses, found at the bottom of the responses page.</p>
                    <h5 class="section scrollspy" id="lectureraccessibilityoption">Accessibility Option</h5>
                    <p>The ``accessibility'' option is implemented throughout the class. This option is a way of keeping students from accessing the specified class, lecture or question. </p>
                    <p>This can be used to make sure students are not responding to questions before you'd like them to, meaning that you will not lose out on responses.</p>
                    <p>This option will also stop users from submitting answers to a closed question.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is a button to reveal the answer.</p>
